# Digital Defiance Homebrew Tap

This tap provides BrightDate time utilities — Rust implementations of classic Unix date/time tools that display time as decimal days since the J2000.0 epoch (2000-01-01T12:00:00 UTC).

## What is BrightDate?

BrightDate represents time as a floating-point number of days since J2000.0 (Julian Date 2451545.0). It provides a compact, precise, and human-readable alternative to Unix timestamps and ISO 8601 strings.

- **Epoch**: J2000.0 = 2000-01-01T12:00:00 UTC = BrightDate 0.0
- **Millidays**: 1 md = 86.4 seconds; 1000 md = 1 day
- **Precision**: up to 12 decimal places

## Install

```sh
brew tap digital-defiance/homebrew-tap
```

Then install any of the tools:

```sh
brew install bdate                  # date replacement — shows current BrightDate
brew install btime                  # time replacement — shows elapsed in BrightDate units
brew install buptime                # uptime replacement — shows system uptime in BrightDate
brew install bcal                   # cal replacement — calendar with BrightDate values
brew install bwatch                 # watch replacement — runs commands with BrightDate timestamps
brew install findutils-brightdate   # find/locate/xargs with BrightDate predicates and format specifiers
```

## Tools

### `bdate` — BrightDate date utility

```
bdate [OPTIONS] [DATE]
```

Shows the current time (or a given date) as a BrightDate value. Supports:

- BrightDate values (`0`, `9123.45`)
- ISO 8601 (`2000-01-01T12:00:00Z`)
- Julian Date (`JD:2451545.0`)
- Modified Julian Date (`MJD:51544.5`)
- Unix milliseconds (integers > 1e10)

Options: `--format bright|millidays|iso|unix|julian|gps|all`, `--precision N`, `--breakdown`, `--tai`, `--diff DATE2`

### `btime` — BrightDate time utility

```
btime COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

Runs a command and prints elapsed time to stderr in days and millidays, along with start/end BrightDate timestamps.

### `buptime` — BrightDate uptime

```
buptime
```

Shows system uptime as `up X.XXXXX days (Y.YYY millidays) — boot BD:ZZZZZ`.

### `bcal` — BrightDate calendar

```
bcal [OPTIONS] [YEAR [MONTH]]
```

Displays a calendar where each date shows its BrightDate value at noon (T12:00:00Z). Supports `--precision N`, `-3` (three-month view), `-y/--year` (full year), `--no-color`.

### `bwatch` — BrightDate watch

```
bwatch [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS...]
```

Repeatedly runs a command, clearing the screen each time and displaying a BrightDate timestamp and elapsed time. Options: `--interval N` (seconds, default 2.0), `--count N` (0 = infinite).

### `bfind`, `blocate`, `bupdatedb`, `bxargs` — BrightDate findutils

GNU findutils 4.10.0 patched to use BrightDate throughout.

```sh
brew install findutils-brightdate
```

| Binary | Description |
|---|---|
| `bfind` | Like `find`, adds `-after <BD>`, `-before <BD>`, and `%Wt`/`%Wa`/`%Wc`/`%WB` printf specifiers |
| `blocate` | Like `locate`, shows BrightDate timestamps in `--statistics` output |
| `bupdatedb` | Like `updatedb`, builds the blocate database |
| `bxargs` | Like `xargs` |

```sh
# Find files modified after BD 9600
bfind . -after 9600.0

# Print BrightDate mtime of every file
bfind . -printf '%p  %Wt\n'

# Find files not touched since BD 9000
bfind . -before 9000.0
```
